# Full-Stack Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to our development program for Full-stack JavaScript Engineers! This is roughly a 3-month program at a regular pace (8h/day) that will take you through the awesome ecosystem of web development, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and much more!

Are you ready? Let's start!

## Code module

We strongly believe that core skills come before learning to use libraries and frameworks. So a lot of your learning focus will be dedicated to understanding the basis web development is based upon. After finishing the code module, you will be able to learn any backend/frontend framework and you will have a much better understanding of what's under the hood of modern web applications.

The core module is built out of the following sub-modules:
* Introduction and Setup
* The Web Platform
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript

## Specialization

Now that you have a strong foundation, it's time to build!

Currently we have development programs for the following specializations:
* React.js
* Node.js

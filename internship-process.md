# A word from the engineering team
During the last couple of years we've had internship batches coming in on a regular basis. Since there are some recurring patterns during the selection process these are some things we've noticed and would like to pass on as "lessons learned":

## Some dos and don'ts before the interview
First and foremost, before you get creative, please note that we're more interested to see that the project is **working**. Make sure you understand the requirements, ask away your questions and get busy hammering out the relevant aspects of your application.

Don't waste time with shiny CSS or Javascript frameworks. We want to see some raw code boiling in there. If you build a UI layer on top of your app and feel comfortable with jQuery, go ahead, but at the same time keep in mind that http://youmightnotneedjquery.com.

We wonâ€™t dismiss your project for lack of folder structure so don't bother much but at the same time make sure your code is neatly written and organised. Use comments where necessary but don't abuse them.

Please, and this is very important, **work on your project by yourself**. We're eager to see what roadblocks you encountered, what was the reasoning behind the decisions you made and how you handled the tasks described in the challenge.

Please, and this is also very important, **be honest during the interview**. This is not an exam, you don't have to cram technology buzzwords one night before so you look cool.

Don't be afraid to admit there are things you don't know, there's no shame in that. Sure, the whole point of the interview is to select one candidate in favour of the other, but it's also a chance to find out where you are on your career path and how we can help you develop further. 

## Some common sense things during the interview
Make sure you budget between 1 and 1/2 hours for the interview. While we're focused on your technical skills, we also want to know what other things make you an awesome human being.

Don't schedule anything before or after **for at least an hour**. Let your friends know you're busy, turn off your phone and try to focus. 

Make sure you know the exact address of the building where your interview will take place. Please note that Fortech has more than one location in the city.

Also, please note that if you have an interview at the CBC office on Henri Barbusse street you'll have to go round the building to the back entrance and take the elevator to the 6th floor. 

Get here 10 minutes earlier. We'll treat you with some coffee or water and make some small talk to break the ice before we proceed with the interview.
